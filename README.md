# <Visualized Sorting>

## Description

This is a sorting algorithm visualizer. There is a slider and text-input field that gets a number, n, and a bar graph filled with numbers in a randomly generated array of length n. There are 5 buttons at the top that each correspond to a sorting algorithm. Clicking on one of these will display the bar graph being sorted with the algorithm specified on the clicked button.

## Usage

1. Drag the slider to adjust the array length. If you want to have a more precise array length, use the text-input field.
2. Click on the button with the sorting algorithm you want to use.
    
    Here is what it looks like when sorting an array:

    ```
    
     ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/Sorting4.png)
    ```

    Here is what it looks like after the array is sorted:
    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/Sorting2.png)
    ```
    
     ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/Sorting4.png)
    ```
